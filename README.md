## Project Phase 3 – Firebase & State Management Integration

In Phase 3, the **CampusVibe** app was significantly enhanced with backend integration and state management to enable a secure, scalable, and reactive experience.

### 🔐 Firebase Authentication
- User registration and login using email/password
- Logout functionality with proper session handling
- Authentication-guarded navigation flow
- Friendly error messages for invalid credentials or network issues

### ☁️ Cloud Firestore Integration
- Events, users, and participation data stored in real-time Firestore collections
- Each record includes `id`, `createdBy`, `createdAt`, and domain-specific fields
- Full **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Real-time updates: changes to event data instantly reflected in UI
- Security rules applied to ensure users can only access or modify allowed content

### ⚙️ Provider-based State Management
- Manages authentication state (e.g., current user, session status)
- Centralized handling of event data, including favorites and participation
- Ensures seamless UI updates when data or login status changes

### 📱 Demo Highlights
- Authentication flow: sign-up, login, logout
- Event list fetching and filtering based on Firestore queries
- Adding, editing, and deleting events
- Real-time updates for newly added or modified events

### 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Flutter** (UI framework)
- **Firebase Authentication**
- **Cloud Firestore**
- **Provider** for state management
